I am currently the AI Research Engineer at Cinnamon AI, working on visually-rich document understanding systems as both research engineer and software engineer.

In my freetime, I do some quantitative trading, watch the market movements, research about algorithmic trading. I always have a thirst for applying cutting-edge AI technology in real life, so I usually spend time exploring the advances of AI technology to build a good background in the field. Sometimes I go jogging, play football and read books about history.


Past Educations:

- Hanoi University of Science and Technology (Bachelor, Talented engineer program in Computer Science) -- graduate of 2020

- High school for gifted students, Hanoi VNU University of Science; major in Physics -- graduate of 2014
